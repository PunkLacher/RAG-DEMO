this soil expansiveness, says a veteran struc-

tural engineer, but it takes knowing what you’re

up against – and a fair degree of patience.

***You are not happy.*** adverse conditions for granted,but there are pockets of expansive soil in just about any setting,coast to coast (see

the sidebar on p.48 for some quick identification tips). Once you ve determined that you re standing on a liftable ![](Aspose.Words.d0d8e617-7bc1-4ad0-af07-a27254637d98.002.png)surface,the most important remedial step you can take is to *pre-saturate* the ground.

This step is too often overlooked,basically because it can mean adding days to the schedule,but the prin-

ciple is very simple: Before you build the deck,you introduce water to the soil and cause it to swell to its full volume. Then you build the deck knowing with a reasonable degree ofcertainty that the ground won t rise any further,even if more water is intro-

duced to it later on down the line.

Decking contractors often make a mistake here: Pre- saturation is not just a matter ofwetting the ground,not by a long shot. Clay may blow up like a sponge once it ab-

sorbs water,but it tends to do so rather slowly. What this ![](Aspose.Words.d0d8e617-7bc1-4ad0-af07-a27254637d98.003.png)![](Aspose.Words.d0d8e617-7bc1-4ad0-af07-a27254637d98.004.png)

A means is that you really have to flood the soil to get the wa-

ter to penetrate and do its job.

Of course,flooding a construction site is a bother for a

variety ofreasons. This is why many decking contractors

lay down a layer ofcrushed rock before flooding: This al-

lows them to flood the yard and still walk around with-

out getting mud all over everything. Better yet,once the

deck is down and life goes on,the soil may continue to ex-

pand a little bit;the crushed rock,with its large voids be-

tween individual rocks,will give the soil a place to go. (Sand

doesn t offer this advantage!)

In general,a four- to six-inch layer of3/4-inch crushed

rock will get the job done. If this isn t a step you take as a

matter ofroutine,you probably should think about it. The ![](Aspose.Words.d0d8e617-7bc1-4ad0-af07-a27254637d98.005.png)

one thing to bear in mind is that you need to drop the grade 

to accommodate the depth of the rock. After the pool or B

waterfeature has been gunited,you can put in your crushed

rock,form it and flood it.

How long the ground needs to soak before you lay the

deck depends on factors such as temperature and humid-

ity. As a rule,you re looking at a week to ten days,but ifthat s

simply too much time,you can speed things up a bit by

spreading some inexpensive powdered detergent on top of

the rock before you hit it with the water. The detergent will

act as a wetting agent and help the water penetrate the soil.

The saturated soil will probably blow up a halfto three-

quarters ofan inch,so you may need to do some final grade

work before you lay the slab.

No matter whether you re dealing with expansive soils C or not,some degree ofcracking in concrete flat work is un-

avoidable as a result ofnatural shrinkage that occurs as the

slab dries over time. Expansion and contraction that come

with temperature changes are also factors here.

To limit this sort ofcracking and,as important,to con-

trol the locations ofcracks,decking contractors install joints

oftwo basic types. Although this is standard procedure for

*all*deck installations,the use of proper joints is especially

critical when building on expansive soil.

- Control Joints. Also known as contraction or ex-

pansion joints,control joints are placed within the slab

itself to enable you,as the name implies,to control crack

problem for a deck, but you wouldn’t 

want to set a footing of any kind on soil 

this unstable.) 

The difference between clay soil and 

regular soil boils down to particle size. 

The particles in clay soils are extreme- 

ly small, where non-expansive soils 

tend to have much coarser particles. 

When thoroughly wetted, clays “blow 

up” because water actually gets sucked 

between the soil particles by a capillary 

action.  The water molecules are drawn 

in and actually push the minute soil par- 

ticles apart, thereby causing what is of- 

ten a dramatic expansion. 

When this happens under a deck, the 

expanding soil will lift the slab, usually 

very slowly, and ultimately cause the 

sort of eyesore that catches a home- 

owner’s eye.  So whenever you spot Crafty Control

The only way you can hold a slab down 

over lifting soil is to set the deck up to have 

so much weight that it overmatches the ex- 

pansive force pushing up beneath it. That s 

not impossible,but it is difficult — and,

frankly,economic realities usually get in the

way ofthis kind ofheavy-duty construc-

tion. In other words,it s generally best to

use pre-saturation and proper joints rather

than sheer mass to hold the soil down.

So what s the thickness standard?  That s

a common question to engineers,and the

best answer is that there is no set rule.

Think about it this way: Ifyou have a 100-

foot slab ofconcrete and the far end lifts,

the deck will crack no matter how thick

**Cantilevered Decks ![](Aspose.Words.d0d8e617-7bc1-4ad0-af07-a27254637d98.011.png)**

Cantilevered pool decking can be used to beautiful visual effect – but expansive soils below (not to mention simple tem- perature-related expansion and contraction) can ruin the impression in rapid order.  The key here, beyond the preventive measures described in the accompanying article, is proper leveling of the top of the bond beam and installation of a “bond breaker” or slip joint on the top of the leveled beam before the deck is poured.  

Without this joint, the waterline tile may become partially attached to the deck and will crack and/or fall off when the deck moves.  Deck movement may also shear off the leveling mortar you place atop the bond beam.

As you install cantilevered decks, also beware a fatal error made all too often:  Do notextend any reinforcing steel from the bond beam into the deck.  There should be no contact whatsoever between these two structures!
