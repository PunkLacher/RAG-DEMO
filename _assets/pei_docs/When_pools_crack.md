Crack

By Ron Lacher

It s unfortunate, but sometimes the concrete structures of watershapes will crack or fail in some other way. Determining the exact cause of such problems is the job of an expert who knows what to look for, says civil en- gineer Ron Lacher, who adds that avoiding trouble involves learning from one s own past mistakes as well as the mistakes of others — and then applying that knowledge in ways that protect future concrete structures against failure.

problems are often apparent through a simple physical inspection,soils issues can,by contrast, be tricky in that pool contractors are not required to be geologists. Nor is a soils report required for each and every job: In newer residential devel- opments,for example,it s presumed that the soil conditions are uniform.

There s also the plain fact that even in situa- tions where a geologist has dug  test pits, soils reports don t always catch everything that s go- ing on in the ground. What this means is that there are gray areas in some situations,so anyone examining a failed structure must gain access to the plans,contracts,soils reports,inspection cer- tificates and any other existing documentation to get to the bottom of things.

More important,it also means that a pool con- tractor needs to be knowledgeable enough to be on the lookout for problems as the project moves forward. Often (but not always),variations in con- ditions that might lead to problems will be open- ly visible,for instance,when the hole is excavated for a pool. That s the case with uncompacted fill, for example,which may have a different color,tex- ture and appearance than will properly compact- ed or otherwise reliable soil.

Many contractors I know are experienced enough to see problems during excavation and can raise the issue with the homeowner before con- struction proceeds. Although such a revelation about soil conditions may result in a structural re- design and typically in increased costs,it s far bet- ter to avoid potential problems up front.

And make no mistake: I m not arguing that con- tractors should act like geologists. Instead,my point is that ifyou see something that looks ques- tionable,it s time to stop working,step back and call in experts to help you make decisions based on firm technical data. Guesswork and  rules of thumb will only lead to trouble.

**ON-SITE EXAMINATION**

When failures do occur,there are so many pos- sible variables involved in a pool s predicament that it is important for the investigator to take an extremely systematic approach to examining the site. In my case,that boils down to a straightfor- ward mental checklist.

Ifa pool has cracked,for example,the first thing I do is compare the actual waterline with the grout lines in the waterline tile to see if the structure is out oflevel or has rotated. Because the actual wa- terline is always level and because the swimming pool tile is supposed to *be*level,you can examine where the water touches the tile and tell whether part ofthe pool has become raised or lowered. (If

With the water lowered beneath the tile line, it s obvious that this pool has shift- ed out of level.  The upper left corner is higher than the upper right corner, and it s easy to see the narrowing band of white as the eye moves along the right side of the vessel.  While the damage is clear, the causes aren t always ob- vious and call for investigation by a professional armed with knowledge and a proper set of forensic tools.

there s no water in the pool,I use an engineer s level on a tripod and com- pare the levels at various points around the pool.![](Aspose.Words.84e6c281-0b40-4fd1-acb1-50610cc2ad20.003.png) A laser or water level will also work.) 

The next thing I look at is the location and orientation of any cracks. If,for example,one end of the pool has settled,you ll typically see a verti- cal crack that s wider at the top (near the bond beam). From this,you can make a reliable assumption that the pool shell has lost support beneath the end that has settled and that the hinge point has emanated as a crack.

Obviously,ifa pool has become out oflevel,part ofthe pool will be high- er than the rest ofit. So how can you tell ifthe higher portion ofthe pool has risen or if the lower portion has settled?  That s a determination that takes years of experience and is based on the location and orientation of the cracking as well as other evidence observed at the site.

If,for example,you see a crack that emanates from the floor or near the bottom ofthe wall,then you start to get the impression that the pool may have been lifted up by expansive soil or hydrostatic pressure.

I m often called to sites where I find a failed pool that has been built be- hind a retaining wall. Ifthe retaining wall is downslope ofthe pool and has a footing that s lower than the bottom of the pool,I immediately suspect that part ofthe pool was built over reliable soil and that part was put on fill. This is what is known as a cut/fill transition,and building on one ofthem generally spells trouble.

Slope creep is another extremely common cause of a cracked or ro-

tated pool. When vessels are located near the top of![](Aspose.Words.84e6c281-0b40-4fd1-acb1-50610cc2ad20.004.png) unretained descending slopes, frequently the surface ofthe slope is pulled slowly downward by gravity,leaving the vessel unsupported. In these situations,it is likely that there will be visual evi- dence of the slope s movement, such as leaning fences or rotated surface improvements near the top of the slope.

I also explore issues of pool movement or rota- tion by inspecting the gaps in expansion or mastic joints that surround coping stones. If,for example, slope creep is influencing the pool shell,I m likely to see mastic joints near the top ofthe slope that are spreading apart or shearing as a result of lateral movement. In the case ofmovement ofa slope up- hill from a pool,I ll usually find compressed joints on the uphill side — that is,the mastic material will bulge out ofthe top ofjoint as the movement ofthe soil compresses adjoining decking slabs.

The presence of the high water tables frequently found in low-lying areas is another possible cause ofstructural failure. In extreme cases,empty pools will lift or float out of the ground. A word of cau- tion: It s not uncommon to float an empty pool that has been placed at the bottom of a nearby ascend- ing slope. Water moving through bedding planes and down the slope saturates the area around the shell and can result in spectacular failures. It s quite a shock to see a floated pool in a hillside area,miles from known high-water-table areas!   ![](Aspose.Words.84e6c281-0b40-4fd1-acb1-50610cc2ad20.005.png)

There are, of course, less-dramatic examples of groundwater-related problems,as when it in- trudes into expansive soils and causes lateral move- ment as well as upward pressure when the soil swells, loses friction and forms slip planes that makes things move.

**SIMPLE TOOLS**

When I inspect failed pools,I carry a couple of very important tools with me. Both are about as low-tech as can be,but they can be extraordinarily helpful in pinpointing problems.

The first is a crow bar. When I see cracking in the shell or on the steps of a pool,I ll just tap the plas- ter surface firmly and listen carefully to the sound. When an area is structurally sound,the bar will make a solid sound with a ring to it. By contrast,when I

One of the ways to tell what s going on with a pool shell in- volves inspecting the mastic joints that separate the coping from the surrounding deck.  If the joint is compressed (as above), I look for an uphill slope that might be creeping and pressing the deck up against the joint.  By contrast, if the joint has widened, there may be movement in a downhill slope that is carrying the deck away from the pool.

With the pool empty, an engineer s level will quick- ly tell you how far out of level the pool has become and in what areas.  (A laser or water level will also do the trick.) This offers many clues to the source of the problem that can be confirmed by additional exploration of the shell, any cracking that may be apparent and the pool s surroundings.![](Aspose.Words.84e6c281-0b40-4fd1-acb1-50610cc2ad20.006.png)

One of my tools is a crowbar.  Where I see cracks, I tap the plaster surface firmly and listen.  When an area is structurally sound, I hear a solid ring. If the area is hollow, there s a distinctly hollow thud. This simple technique tells me a lot about what s going on beneath a pool s surface.

tap an area that is hollow (such as damaged plaster or delaminated gunite), there s a distinctly hollow sound. This is a simple technique that gives me im- portant information about where the problems are beneath a pool s surface.

Another favorite tool is a probe — a simple,straight,narrow metal bar with a  T at one end for a handle and a point at the other end. Soil technicians are frequently seen using this tool when examining the bottom of pool exca- vations. Under firm pressure,the pointed end of the probe should not pene- trate competent soil.

If penetration into the subgrade soil is easy after portions of the pool shell have been removed,it s a clear sign that the underlying soil is the likely culprit in the vessel s structural distress. Ifthat penetration is not easy,the soil is much more likely to be suitable.

(For contractors,this exercise would be particularly useful during excavation when soil differences are spotted. Keep in mind that when the probe won t pen- etrate the pool s subgrade soil it s only one indicator,not a guarantee that the soil is suitable for the structure. By contrast,if the probe easily penetrates the subgrade soil,you can rest assured that you re working on material that likely will not support a heavy concrete structure such as a pool.

(It s important to remember that these tools and techniques are — in no way,

shape or form — any substitute for a certified soils reports or proper engineering. Just the same,they can be very helpful in helping to avoid problems down the line.)  

In general,my informal observations on site with my crowbar and probe will almost always lead to an examination ofa soils report and/or the grading plan for the home or subdivision. Often times,I will spot cut/fill transitions or other soil conditions that might be congruent with movement ofthe pool shell. I might also see the presence ofbedding planes that might transmit groundwater through the area or ob- serve soil types that may result in slope creep.

As mentioned above,mass-graded housing subdivisions will often have soils reports that apply to the entire area. In these situations,you can generally count on the reliability ofthe soil, but I ve also seen situations where the grading

and compaction wasn t properly supervised and problems have arisen in specific areas. Again,the best place to catch those sorts of prob- lems is during construction — and especially during excavation.

Because there is no certainty without a detailed soils report re- flecting conditions on a specific plot ofland,I always tell builders to watch for soils that just don t look quite right. Excavators can be par- ticularly helpful here and should be reminded to inform the pool contractor if they encounter any significant differences in the tex- ture or firmness ofthe soil as they remove it.

If available,construction photos or even some before-and-after photos ofthe site can be helpful in determining the cause ofa sub- sequent problem. Photographs taken ofslopes before construction, of the excavation process or during construction of retaining walls are particularly valuable when it comes to understanding the caus- es offailure.

**WORKMANSHIP ISSUES**

For all ofthe variables introduced by soils conditions and ground- water intrusion,there are times when the real problem leading to a cracked shell is a failure ofworkmanship. Improper gunite or shot- crete application — especially in the form ofinadequate coverage of reinforcing steel — is probably the most common ofthese issues.

One of the things I look for when I suspect such failures is what I call  reflective cracking.  This is the series ofcracks that sometimes forms in the pattern ofthe reinforcing steel in the concrete shell,and I ve seen it in a lot in spa dams and other freestanding walls,includ- ing vanishing-edge weir walls. In these cases,the gunite has not prop- erly encased the steel,which can happen ifthe reinforcement is out of position for some reason or if the thickness of the gunite ap-

A probe — that is, a long bar pointed at one end with a  T  han- dle at the other — is used to check on the condition of the soil around a shell.  If the probe enters the soil easily, it is unlikely that the soil is supporting the shell adequately.  If the soil resists, the soil may be competent — meaning we need to find the source of the problem elsewhere.

plied over the reinforcement is insufficient.

Another common cause offailure is steel that hasn t been adequately tied. When gunite or shotcrete is applied,ma- terial comes out ofthe hose at a high velocity and hits the re- inforcing steel,causing it to vibrate. Ifthe steel has not been properly tied,this vibration can lead to expanses ofshell with incomplete encasement. The result is effectively an unre- inforced shell that will be susceptible to reflective cracking.

Another common workmanship failure involves in- stallation of decking that lacks proper expansion joints. This can lead to extensive cracking in the decking because the decks can t move freely with any expansion ofthe soil. We also see problems with the expansion joints that sep- arate the coping from the deck: If they re not properly installed pressure against the bond beam from temper- ature expansion ofthe deck will often lead to horizontal cracks at the tile line.

There are numerous other workmanship issues — skim- mer installation,for instance,or the interfacing of shells with cantilevered decks or the installation of artificial or real rockwork — that can come into play. The potential problems here are so substantial that discussion of them will have to wait for another article.

The most important point to take away from this dis- cussion now is that each setting,each pool and each failure is a little bit different. This can sometimes lead to frustra- tion with the inspection process,because there is strong de- sire for a clear-cut resolution and an agreed-upon course ofremediation.

In California,which is where I do much of my work,it is fortunate that there are rules governing these investiga- tions that allow me to render my opinions based on estab- lished standards. Sometimes,the homeowner or the con- tractor who is left to foot the cost of rehabilitating a pool will disagree with my findings,however,and will end up taking the matter to attorneys and into court.

I know from my own experience as an expert witness that it s tough to predict how things will go in court or fore- cast how a jury will respond to the information presented during a trial. If you honestly think the homeowner or a developer or someone else should bear the responsibility for the failure,press on. Ifnot,be aware as a contractor that once you enter the legal realm,you might just end up los- ing more than you would have had you simply bitten the bullet in the first place.

Better yet,I suggest paying attention to details of soils, groundwater or workmanship in the first place — and avoid- ing problems completely.
