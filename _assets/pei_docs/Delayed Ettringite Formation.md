1. **Introduction**

The problem of durability of concrete with cement as binding material comes more and more to the fore with the increased use of concrete, with the changed production and utilization conditions,  and  with  the  further  development  and  adaptation  of  concrete  properties  by changing  concrete  composition.  Processes  in  connection  with  the  ettringite  formation  in concrete are belong to the partly unsolved problems. While the primary ettringite formation in the initial stage of the hydration is seen as apositive effect because it enables the setting regulation,  a  damaging  role  is  often  attributed  to  the  ettringite  formation  in  hardened concrete. Damaged concretes often show large amounts of ettringite in structure damages even if they were not exposed to heat treatment (e.g. pavement concrete).

One of the first publications about concrete-damaging late ettringite formation appeared in 1945 by Lerch [1]. Kennerly of New Zealand [2] gave a report of similar findings in 1965, and Volkwein [3] in 1979. A characteristic feature of this type of damage is the conspicuous formation of ettringite in voids, cracks, and the contact zone between the aggregate and the hardened cement paste without any external sulfate attack having taken place. Damage in conjunction with ettringite formation in hardened concrete was first identified in heat-treated, precast concrete elements which, during use, had been exposed to open-air weathering with frequent wetting. The concretes affected were mainly high-grade concretes of high strength and low porosity. Conspicuous formation of ettringite in distorted micro-structural defects and  in  voids  is  also  being  observed  increasingly  in  conjunction  with  damage  in  concrete components which have not been heat-treated. Investigations have now also been carried out into this formation of new phases, known as late ettringite formation, which takes place under normal ambient conditions in concretes which have not been heat-treated.

After  carrying  out  extensive  investigations  different  hypothesis  were  developed  by  many authors on how ettringite formation in hardened concrete and therefore a damage mechanism can be initiated, and it is said that the formation mechanism [4-6] and different ettringite modifications  [7]  play  an  important  role.  It  was  found  that  a  heat  treatment  at  higher temperatures [8-13], influence of frost- or freezing-thawing [14, 15], carbonation processes [16, 17], moisture affect [18] and with it moisture and temperature changes such as occurring under  natural  conditions  [19,  20]  can  cause  ettringite  formation  in  hardened  concrete.  A complex occurrence of ettringite formation and further crack causing damage mechanisms such as ASR was found [21-24]. An ettringite formation in hardened concrete does not in every  case  lead  to  a  direct  damage  of  the  concrete  structure.  At  present,  there  is  still controversy whether different types of ettringite exist; whether the damage mechanism can be initiated  by  coarse-  or  fine-crystalline  ettringite;  whether  the  formation  of  large  ettringite crystals in hardened concrete, which also occur without heat treatment, is the primary cause of damages in the micro structure or if it only causes damage-promoting changes in the micro structure; and which practical consequences the ettringite filling of artificial air voids may have.

Despite extensive investigations in connection with ettringite formation, the direct cause of damage, the chronological development of the concrete damaging mechanism, and the role of different  influences  such  as  pre-damages,  sulfate,  and  alkali  content  were  not  yet  clearly solved.

The presence of ettringite crystals in the concrete is frequently equated with harmful ettringite formation. So far, however, no clear connection has ever been proven between the emergence of cracks and the recrystallization of ettringite. Similarly, calcite in concrete cracks is not the cause of the cracks, the cracks emerge as a consequence of other damage mechanisms, e.g. mechanical stresses, shrinkage, or expansive reactions.

2. **Ettringite in fresh concrete**

According to the latest findings the primary ettringite formation from C3A and gypsum in the presence of calcium hydroxide puts into action right after water addition:

**3 CaO** × **Al2O3 + 3 CaSO4 + 26 H2O** ® **3 CaO** × **Al2O3** × **3 CaSO4** × **32 H2O**

This reaction ends as soon as the sulfate concentration, needed for forming the ettringite, decreases below the limit. From this point the remaining C3A reacts by partly solution of the already formed ettringite to monosulfate and solid solutions between C3AC`SH12 - C4AH13 which  in  aqueous  solution  again  form  ettringite  and  tetracalcium  aluminate  hydrate.  The compound SO3 with a percent of 9.1, i.e. 19 % gypsum, would be necessary, for example, to transform 10% C3A fully into ettringite. However, in accordance with EN 197-1, the sulfate content is limited to a maximum of 3.5 to 4 %, depending on the type and strength class of the cement. Therefore, monosulfate is always formed as well.

Therefore, the sulfate deficit which occurs during hydration due to the consumption of sulfate is the cause of the decomposition of the ettringite. The ettringite decomposition at high alkali contents must begin earlier, because with increasing alkali content for the ettringite formation higher sulfate contents in the solution phase are necessary [32]. If the decomposition of the primary ettringite is not completed, then ettringite as well as monosulfate occurs in the normal hardened concrete (fig. 1). During the first hours of hydration shape and size of the ettringite and monosulfate crystals mainly change in dependence of the solution composition and due to this the setting behavior is influenced [75].

Ettringite (C6A`S3H32) forms hexagonal-prismatic crystals. According to the structure model by  TAYLOR  [76],  the  crystals  are  based  on  columns  of  cations  of  the  composition

{Ca3[Al(OH)6]  12 H2O}3+. In there, the Al(OH)63--octahedra are bound up with the edge- sharing CaO8-polyhedra, that means each aluminum-ion, bound into the crystal, is connected

to Ca2+-ions, with which they share OH- ions . The intervening channels contain the SO 2--

4 tetrahedra and the remaining H2O molecules (fig. 2). The H2O molecules are partly bound

very loose into the ettringite structure. Due to this, the easy slit off of part of the water during drying or increased temperatures can be explained and, therefore, the existence of ettringite with different crystal water contents.

3. **Ettringite in hardened concrete**

Scanning electron photomicrographs show that ettringite (3CaO × Al2O3 × 3CaSO4 × 32 H2O) occurs in concrete in various forms, often as spherical clusters of ettringite crystals, felt-like or parallel needles of differing sizes. If ettringite crystallizes out without spatial obstruction, e.g. in pores, then it has the typical needle-shaped crystal habit.

Investigations at the Bauhaus-University Weimar into the crystal habit of ettringite by means of  an  environmental  scanning  electron  microscope  (ESEM),  i.e.  with  no  influence  by  the method of preparation (drying, vapor deposition, high vacuum), were carried out on ettringite present in severely damaged concretes and on synthesized ettringite. It was found that the fairly large, needle-shaped ettringite crystals (thickness in the µm range) found previously during  the  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  investigations  under  high  vacuum  often consisted of many parallel, very slender, crystals with thickness in the range between 20 and 200 nm lying close to one another (Figs. 3, 4), regardless of whether the ettringite crystallized with or without spatial obstraction in the concrete or formed synthetically in a solution. By investigations with SEM a vapor deposited carbon layer with a thickness of about 30 nm was necessary but covered up the fine structures.

The causes of the many different forms in which ettringite appears are not yet fully explained. Some influencing factors seem to be the composition, the concentration conditions and the pH value  of  the  concrete  pore  solution  [7,  9,  25-28],  as  well  as  the  formation  mechanism (through-solution mechanism or solid state reaction), the inclusion of foreign ions, etc. According to Chartschenko's investigations in [27, 28], for example, the length-thickness ratio of  synthesized  ettringite  crystals  is  extremely  dependent  on  the  pH  value  of  the  reaction solution (Fig. 5). Long, fiber-shaped crystals were formed at pH values between 10 and 12, but extremely microcrystalline ettringite was present at pH values above 13.0.

Mehta [7] describes two modifications of ettringite which differ in habit and size. The long, lath-like crystals which could be 10 to 100 µm long and several µm thick and formed at low hydroxyl ion concentrations, i.e. with low pH values in the pore solution, were designated by Mehta as Type I. If hydrated cements contain considerable amounts of these large ettringite crystals, this leads to high strengths, but not to expansion effects. Mehta therefore proposed that Type I ettringite as not expansive. The rod-like crystals which are only 1 to 2 µm long and 0,1 to 0,2 µm thick or even smaller, and which form at high hydroxyl ion concentrations which are present during the hydration of portland cements were taken by Mehta as Type II ettringite. According to Mehta, fairly large quantities of this microcrystalline ettringite can cause expansion effects through water adsorption.

Damage mechanisms on concrete are often brought in connection with the appearance form and formation mechanism of ettringite.

4. **Problematic**

It has been assumed so far that in normally hardened concrete the formation of ettringite which begins immediately during hydration is completed after about 24 h. The ettringite is said to be then distributed evenly in the hardened cement paste, probably in a microcrystalline form.  Using  SEM  and  microanalysis  it  cannot  be  located  with  certainty  either  in  the microstructure or in the existing spaces such as capillaries or air voids, etc. In most cases, it is also  not  possible  to  detect  ettringite  in  the  concrete  by  X-ray  diffraction  or  differential thermo-analysis.

After comparison of published data on the stability domain of ettringite [e.g. 1, 25-33] and the composition of the pore solution in the hardened cement paste [e.g. 9, 34-41], mortar, or concrete, meaning the existence medium of the hydrate phases, the question arises whether or not ettringite can still exist in the hardened cement paste.

Note: The calculation of the pH value from the OH-ion concentration (H+-ion concentration) is normally only possible, if the total concentration of the solution is set not above 0.1n. For the assessment and comparability of the different specifications mentioned in literature in this presentation, however, a theoretical pH-value was calculated from the ion concentration, whereby the ion concentration was equated with the ion activity.

In concretes stored or permanently used in a dry climate (e.g. interior elements), ettringite is hardly  detectable,  even  after  many  years  of  use.  However,  if  a  concrete  is  exposed  to alternating moisture conditions during use, then ettringite crystals can be detected in the voids already  after  a  short  time  (6  months)  without  evidence  of  any  serious  impairment  of  the properties of the solid concrete. A white layer enriched with ettringite is often found on aggregate surfaces. If the concrete has been heat-treated or if elevated temperatures occur during drying the effect of accumulation of ettringite in pores and contact zones between aggregate and hardened cement paste is enhanced. In damaged concrete, ettringite is also to be found in the cracks.

Therefore, it is necessary to clarify which processes in hardened concrete can lead to the observed accumulation of ettringite, and which mechanism makes „invisible“ ettringite visible. The correlations between the composition of the liquide phase in the hardened cement past, mortar,  or  concrete  and  the  existence  and  stability  of  ettringite  seem  to  be  the  decisive influence.

5. **Present hypotheses on the formation of ettringite in hardened concrete**

The possible causes of accumulation of ettringite in the hardened concrete are as follows:

1) additional formation of ettringite by internal sulfate release, e.g. from existing monosulfate or other sulfate-free phases, combined with transport processes, and
1) mobilization  of  existing  ettringite  and/or  its  constituents,  their  transport  and recrystallization (with grain growth).

   So far the investigations into ettringite formation in hardened concrete led to the following hypotheses:

1. **Internal sulfate sources and late sulfate release**

After heat-treatment

Ettringite  formation  in  hardened  concrete  after  heat-treatment  is  often  traced  back  to temperatures in concrete above the stability limit of ettringite. With rising temperature there is a drop in the thermodynamic stability of ettringite in favor of monosulfate. Depending on the thermodynamic  data  the  theoretical  transformation  temperature  from  ettringite  into monosulfate  ranges  between  70  and  90°C.  The  stability  limit  of  the  ettringite  falls  with increasing alkali content in the pore solution as described by Wieker et al. [9, 36]. Concrete temperatures above the respective stability limit of the ettringite can lead to decomposition of the ettringite, e.g. with the formation of monosulfate and sulfate. With a subsequent drop in temperature the monosulfate becomes metastable so that, if there is sufficient water available (moisture effects) ettringite can be formed again.

According to Ludwig et al. [8, 42-46], these processes take place under the conditions of heat-treatment with subsequent moist conditions. But fairly high concrete temperatures can also occur during concrete placement under elevated external temperatures (summer weather) [47], can be attributed to the use of hot cement and/or can be a result of the liberated heat of hydration  which  cause  temperatures  of  more  than  70  °C,  especially  in  massive  concrete elements. Similar processes may occur in concretes which have not been heat-treated but during use are exposed to temperatures above the stability limit of ettringite and to varying ambient moisture. The temperature of 60°C in concrete panels was found to be realistic under intensive sun-radiation by measuring the temperature in the upper layer of open-air stored concrete panels (fig. 7). Other authors also reported temperatures of 60°C to 80°C for dark surfaces which can occur e.g. in exposed concrete pavement segments, external wall elements, bridge segments, parking decks and so on [48-50].

According to recent investigations, the ettringite formation in hardened concrete after heat treatment  can  be  traced  back  to  the  increased  sulfate  binding  ability  of  C-S-H  phases  at elevated temperatures [12, 13, 51, 52]. According to current understanding, the majority of the SO 2- is adsorptively, i.e. physically, attached to the C-S-H and is therefore available as

mobile  sulfate  which  is  available  at  later  moisture  storage  of  the  concrete  at  lower temperatures.  After  heat-treatment  ettringite  is  formed  under  service  conditions  (low temperature, elevated moisture) from monosulfate and C3AH6 both with the SO42- from the alkali sulfates in the pore solution and with the SO42- attached to the C-S-H. This delayed ettringite formation takes place unless sulfate is supplied from outside.

Practical  experience  has  shown  that  damage  to  concrete  as  a  result  of  delayed  ettringite formation due to heat-treatment can be avoided by complying with the “Guidelines for heat- treatment of concrete“, issued by the German Committee for Reinforced Concrete. This lays down specifications for the heat-treatment, such as the minimum duration for the pre-storage period and the maximum temperature of the concrete, depending on the expected exposure of the concrete to moisture under the conditions of use.

Freeze-thaw attack with and without de-icing salt

According to investigations by Stark and Ludwig, H.-M. [14, 15, 53-55], ettringite can be formed  from  monosulfate  during  freeze-thaw  attacks  with  and  without  de-icing  salt. Monosulfate is always formed during the hydration, as described above. Ettringite is very stable under freeze-thaw attacks, while monosulfate is partially transformed into ettringite [53]. The sulfate which this requires was not available before the frost attack occured. It can therefore be assumed that the additional sulfate required is supplied by partial decomposition of the monosulfate due to carbonation or due to partial transformation of monosulfate into monochloride during the freeze-thaw attack with de-icing salt (fig. 8). Gypsum is liberated during  this  process  and  can  form  additional  ettringite  with  the  not  yet  decomposed  or transformed  monosulfate.

Carbonation

A  different  model  described  by  Kuzel  et  al.  [16,  17,  56-58]  explains  the  late  or  delayed ettringite  formation  from  monosulfate  under  the  combined  action  of  CO2  and  water. According to this, the monosulfate is decomposed by carbonation to form CaCO3, Al(OH)3, gypsum, and water via the intermediate stages of hemicarbonate and monocarbonate. The liberated  gypsum  is  available  for  reaction  with  unreacted  monosulfate  to  form  ettringite. However, as the action of CO2 progresses, the ettringite structure is also destroyed with elimination of gypsum. It was not yet determined whether the ettrinigte formation through the carbonation is of practical importance.

Clinker

It is suspected that the sulfate initially fixed in the clinker forms another internal source of sulfate [59]. This sulfate could be liberated by advancing hydration of the clinker components during use and therefore could be available for additional ettringite formation in the hardened concrete  without  any  external  supply  of  sulfate.  However,  cement  clinker  of  normal composition cannot contain any anhydrite [60, 61] because at a kiln temperature of 1450°C, CaSO4 is thermally decomposed into CaO, SO2, and oxygen. Only in C4A3S clinkers, which are  produced  at  about  1300°C  and  are  used  for  the  production  of  expansive  cements, anhydrite could occur in small quantities.

Cement clinker in Central Europe nearly always contains more alkalis than sulfate; therefore, after  the  clinker  is  burnt,  the  sulfate  is  mostly  combined  as  alkali  sulfates.  K2SO4  is  an independent phase in the clinker which does not mix with the clinker melt. It solidifies last and covers the alite and other clinker minerals with a thin layer (fig 9a, b). These alkali sulfates dissolve immediately in contact with water.

Only a very small quantity of sulfate, less than 0.5 %, is fixed in the clinker phases and is liberated only during the hydration progress. In practice, for normal clinker sulfate contents, this sulfate can be ruled out as an internal source of sulfate as an initiation of the formation of ettringite which could damage concrete. Common sulfate contents of characteristic cement clinker compositions are given in table 1.

2. **Alternating moisture conditions**

Moisture  can  cause  mobilization  of  the  phase  constituents  in  the  concrete.  Alternating moisture  conditions  lead  to  moisture  gradients  in  the  concrete.  These  produce  moisture movements, transport of substances, concentration differences in the concrete microstructure, and  transfer  of  substances  with  the  surroundings,  which  can  cause  a  change  in  the composition of the pore solution and a reduction in the content of water-soluble alkalis in the concrete.

Fig. 10: Ettringite has - by directed crystal growth - partly filled an air void

Various investigation results (Johansen and Thaulow [6, 18, 62, 63], Scrivener and Wieker et al. [51, 64], Stark and Bollmann [19, 20, 40, 41, 65]) show that under these conditions an accumulation of ettringite in pores, cracks, and weak parts of the structure is promoted. It is assumed that ettringite formed at high pH values is most likely microcrystalline, amorphous to X-rays, and less stable; therefore, it gradually dissolves in the pore liquid of a moist concrete and recrystallize. Transport processes taking place in the capillaries are interrupted by air voids, cracks, and contact zones between aggregate and hardened cement paste, for example. In such places this leads to enrichment of the transported substances and could also explain the observed accumulation of ettringite in the air voids (fig. 10) which were previously filled with air or water.

3. **Marginal conditions which promote damage**

Predamage to the concrete![](Aspose.Words.aa3d7503-ea2e-4fd3-b196-48d808cbd794.020.png)

Every concrete contains weak points and micro damage to the internal structure, e.g. pores, distorted transition zones between aggregate and hardened cement paste, cracks. They do not necessarily impair the quality of the hardened concrete (strength, modulus of elasticity etc.), but they can promote the transport of moisture and phase forming components and therefore aid  ettringite  crystallization.  Physical  causes  for  this,  can,  for  example,  be  a  segregation phenomena caused by compaction (faults in the contact zone between aggregate and hardened cement paste and in the areas close to the surface); stresses in the microstructure through temperature or moisture gradients; differing thermal expansion coefficients of the concrete constituents, shrinkage, mechanical stresses, and freeze-thaw attack with and without de-icing salt. Microstructural damages can be produced chemically by expansion reactions (alkali-silica reaction, free CaO or MgO) and chemical shrinkage (self-desiccation at w/c’s £ 0.3).

Influence of the pore volume

If  the  transport  of  moisture  and  phase  components  can  take  place  in  the  concrete microstructure, then very dense concretes, with low porosity and fine-pored microstructures, are more sensitive under otherwise identical conditions than less dense concretes of higher porosity and coarse-pored microstructure. The reason for this is that concretes with fairly high water-cement ratios or entrained air voids have a greater potential expansion space for the formation of new phases.

Because of the great importance of the pore structure for concrete-damaging late ettringite formation, the results of investigations on mortar prisms cannot be applied directly to concrete.

Cement content and concrete composition

High cement contents not only result in higher concrete temperatures during hydration, but also increase the quantity of potential reaction partners for ettringite formation and, as a result,  the  quantity  of  ettringite  per  volume  unit  of  concrete.  This  also  increases  the probability  that  the  pore  volume  will  not  be  sufficient  to  take  the  quantity  of  ettringite produced in the already hardened concrete.

A CEM I 42.5 R cement with a C3A content of 7.6 % (calculation according to Bogue) and an SO content of 2.3 % can, at most, form 12.02 g ettringite/100 g cement. With a cement

conten3t of 300 kg/m3 concrete and an ettringite density of 1.77 g/cm3, it corresponds to a volume of 2.04 % ettringite in a cubic meter of concrete. If, with the same cement content,

the  sulfate  content  of  the  cement  is  increased  to  4.0  %,  then  this  results  in  a  maximum ettringite  volume  of  3.54  %  by  volume.  With  increasing  quantity  of  cement,  there  is  a corresponding increase in the proportion of ettringite by volume. This is contrasted with an average pore volume in solid concrete of 9 to 15 % by volume in normal concrete, therefore, in concrete with a normal composition the maximum amount of ettringite that can be formed is smaller than the total pore volume. This indicates that it is not the total pore volume but rather  the  pore  size  distribution  which  must  be  of  decisive  importance  for  the  degree  of damage.

Portland  cements  (apart  from  highly  sulfate-resisting  cements)  always  have  excess  C3A relative to  sulfate,  so  the  sulfate  governs  the  maximum  quantity  of  ettringite  that  can  be formed. This is the reason why the sulfate content is often held responsible for the occurrence of  concrete  damage.  However,  so  far  no  clear  connection  has  been  proven  between  the normal sulfate levels in Portland cement and the expansion of the concrete, the occurrence of damage, and the degree of damage.

As  already  mentioned,  the  alkali  content of the cement affects not only the temperature- dependent stability limit of the ettringite, but also the composition and the pH of the pore solution  in  the  concrete,  which,  according  to  Mehta  [7],  affects  the  ettringite,  whether forming fine or coarse crystals. The alkali levels in the range between 0.8 and 1.2 % Na2O- equivalents, which are normal in portland cements, always lead to pH values between 13.5 and 14 during the initial hydration with low water-cement ratios (Fig. 6). The question arises whether the ettringite can be formed under these conditions or whether formed ettringite remains stable. If there is no carbonation or leaching while the concrete is in use, then these high pH values remain and the ettringite therefore retains its initial form.

6. **Further hypotheses on the formation of ettringite in hardened concrete**

The temperature dependent stability of ettringite is often cited for explanations, but cannot be the cause for ettringite enrichments in many damage cases on non-heat treated concretes and on concretes damaged by ASR. As already mentioned, a decisive influence seem to have the connections between composition of the pore solution in hardened cement paste, mortar, or concrete and the existence- and stability range of ettringite.

1. **Pore Solution** 
1. **Composition of the Pore Solution**

According to the latest findings, the composition of the pore solution can be best determined after  a  phase  selection  solid-liquid  by  means  of  squeezing  the  pore  solution  out  of  the hardened  cement  paste  under  high  pressures  of  320  MPa  [66]  up  to  375  MPa  [34]  and analysis of ion concentrations in the liquid phase.

In the early phase of hydration, as long as still unhydrated parts are available, the ions in the solution  phase  are  not  in  thermodynamical  balance  with  the  solid  materials  because  this condition  is  determined  by  permanent  solution  and  precipitation  processes.  Therefore, hydration times of 28 days and more were mostly set for the assessment. The chronological development of the ion concentration shows that for most cements no substantial changes in the pore solution composition are to be expected after these periods.

The main part of the alkalies goes into solution with the beginning hydration. The further increase of the concentration is attributed to the consumption of the solution phase during hydration. At water-cement ratios of 0.5, the pH value of the pore solution in the hardened cement paste of most of the common portland cements (except low-alkali cements) is higher than 13.6 already after 1 day. Due to the further consumption of the solution phase during the ongoing hydration, the pH value increases and reaches values higher than 13.8 already after 28 days (fig. 11). In practice essentially lower water-cement ratios are often used so that the ion concentrations are much higher due to the low content of solution phase. This means that the  medium  surrounding  the  hydrate  phases  shows  mostly  OH-ion  concentrations  above 600mmol/l.

2. **Influences affecting the composition of the pore solution**

In concrete elements which were affected by natural climate changes during service life, the composition of the pore solution inevitably changes due to the influence of moisture. While this process goes on slowly in less-permeable structures and mainly affects the areas close to the surface, the high capillary porosity and micro damages can promote this process so that deeper areas could be affected faster. The alkali content and with it the OH-ion content in the pore solution can strongly be reduced by the above described process.

This becomes evident through tests on very small hardened cement paste- and mortar prisms (10mm x 10mm x 100mm) which were exposed to continuous storage under water or in air already after 1 day. After a storage time of 1 year, the chemical analysis clearly shows that the content of water soluble alkalies is strongly reduced (fig. 12), which therefore affects the composition  of  the  pore  solution  regarding  the  pH  value  reduction.  Furthermore,  after continuous storage in water, the content of strongly bound alkalies is lower than after storage in air so that one can safely assume that the originally strongly bound alkalies in the cement are also available in water soluble condition during hydration. Thereby the Na2O-content, which only is about 1/5 of the K2O-content, is reduced in the same way like the K2O-content. Due to the continuous storage of the samples in water and the resulting leaching process occurring at the same time, the content of alkalies which are strongly bound in the hydration products is lower. On the other hand, the content of sulfates remains the same, independent of the  type  of  storage  (fig.  12),  so  that  this  reactant  which  is  necessary  for  the  ettringite formation will also be available with continuous storage in water.

Besides external influences which can lead to a reduction of the pH value, other mechanisms can influence the composition of the liquid phase. The integration of alkalies into the reaction products belongs to this. The boundage of alkalies into the alkali-silica gel e.g. also leads to a reduction of the alkali content in the surrounding solution.

2. **Ettringite**
1. **Synthesis**

Ettringite occurs only in minimal amounts in concrete and hardened cement paste, so that analytical investigations are more difficult or are nearly impossible. For this reason model systems  were  used  for  the  investigations.  By  stoichometrical  composition  of  the  reaction components  ettringite  precipitated  from  the  solution,  whereby  in  essence  no  other  solid reaction  products  were  synthesized.  The  pH  value  of  the  medium  depends  on  the  ions remaining in the solution under equilibrium conditions in dependence of solubility and stability of the ettringite. The measured pH value was set at 10.7. According to investigations in [25, 26], the value of 10.7 was set as the minimum limit for the stability of ettringite.

In systems with cement as binding material, the pH value normally depends on the alkalies and is set, as described, in an area above the pH value of 13.0. Therefore, the pH value was varied in model tests by the addition of KOH to the reaction solution. Measuring the pH value in such highly concentrated alkali hydroxide solutions is very problematic and faulty; therefore, the theoretical pH value calculated from the OH--ion concentration was used again.

From an OH--ion concentration of 320 mmol/l (theoretical calculated pH value 13.51), not only ettringite but also monocarbonate was increasingly formed. Ettringite was formed in small amounts up to an OH-ion concentration of 370 mmol/l, meaning a theoretical pH value of  13.57.  From  an  OH-ion  concentration  of  400 mmol/l  (theoretical  calculated  pH  value 13.6),  only  the  sulfate-free  compounds  monocarbonate  and  portlandite  (calcite)  were essentially established as crystalline reaction products by means of XRD (fig. 13), whereby the sulfate content of the solution phase increased. The formation of monocarbonate as well as calcite was attributed to the fact that the investigations could not be carried out in a CO2-free atmosphere, so that an eventual formation of monosulfate could not be proven.

Under  the  chosen  test  conditions  (influence  of  OH--ions  and  CO32--ions),  no  ettringite formation was possible at pH values above 13.6 as it occurs at normal portland cements already after one day of hydration and at water-cement ratios of 0.5. Low-sulfate or sulfate- free reaction products were formed which are unstable and therefore carbonate easily under

CO2-influence. The dependence of the ettringite morphology on the OH--ion concentration in the  reaction  solution,  often  mentioned  in  literature,  was  not  proven  in  the  investigations carried out by means of the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope.

2. **Decomposition**

Normally the primary ettringite formation in concrete occurs predominantly within the first hours of hydration. During this time the pH value of the pore solution depends on the amount of instantly soluble alkalies and therefore is still set at about 13.0 within the first hour [41]. Only with ongoing hydration the increase of the OH--ion concentration continues due to the consumption of the solution phase. With it the question arises whether the primary formed ettringite remains stable under the changed pH-conditions of the surrounding solution phase.

The tests show that the ettringite precipitated in the solution becomes increasingly unstable with the following increase of the pH value of the solution due to addition of KOH. The ettringite becomes less stable the higher the pH-value becomes. Ettringite starts to slowly decompose at OH--ion concentrations of 400 and 500 mmol/l. At higher ion-concentrations this  process  intensifies  and  in  turn  the  sulfate-free  reaction  products  monocarbonate  and portlandite forms under the influence of CO2 (fig. 14). Sulfate can be established in increasing amounts  in  the  solution  phase.  Furthermore  according  to  [32],  the  sulfate  concentration arising in the solution increases with increasing concentrations of alkali hydroxides in the solution. The decomposition of ettringite occurs as long as the ion concentration arising in the liquid phase reaches the equilibrium with the solid materials. With this a dependence arises between the ettringite decomposition and the amount of the solution phase.

1) - KOH = 550 mmol/l (all peaks E; exception - 2 peaks M);
1) - KOH = 770 mmol/l (all peaks E; exception - 2 peaks M, 1 peak P)

Further investigations in which already carefully dried synthetic ettringite was exposed to a KOH-solution with a mass ratio of 1:25 proved true the decomposition processes of the ettringite in the alkaline environment. Ettringite was completely decomposed within 3 days at an OH--concentration of 770 mmol/l with predominantly monocarbonate and calcite and small amounts of aragonite and vaterite; gypsum and syngenite were formed as crystalline end- products (Abb. 15). Once again, it is to assume that sulfate-free calcium aluminate hydrate phases or monosulfate and portlandite will be formed under CO2-free conditions, which would be available for a reformation of ettringite.

With this it cannot be excluded that the ettringite primary formed in the hardened cement paste will be transformed into low-sulfate compounds at increasing pH values due to the hydration progress, whereby the sulfate appears partly in the solution phase.

3. **Re-crystallization**

During  the  utilization  due  to  external  and  internal  influences  a  decrease  of  the  OH-- concentration is possible mainly in pre-damaged concrete. Due to this fact pH-conditions can arise  again  under  which  ettringite  could  exist.  As  already  mentioned  the  reaction  partner sulfate necessary for the ettringite re-crystallization from the low-sulfate components also remains in the structure after leaching processes, so that a re-crystallization can occur.

The tests carried out with carefully dried synthetic ettringite also showed these results. After this  ettringite  was  completely  decomposed due to the addition of KOH, it essentially  re- crystallized at pH value reduction due to dilution effects (addition of water). Small amounts of calcite  and  monocarbonate  still  remain  (fig.  15).  It  is  to  assume  that  a  complete  re- crystallization is possible under CO2-free conditions.

The occurrence of larger amounts of ettringite mainly in porous, cracked or ASR-damaged concretes can therefore be attributed to a re-crystallization of ettringite which occurred due to the changed pH-conditions.

3. **Consequences for the ettringite formation in hardened concrete**

An  application  of  the  results  from  the  investigations  on  the  pore  solution  and  of  the investigations on the stability of synthetic ettringite in alkaline model solutions onto the real- system concrete makes clear that in sound concrete with ongoing hydration development pH values often exist in the solution phase under which the primary formed ettringite can not be stable. While primary ettringite formation can occur at pH values which are set around 13.0 using ordinary portland cements with an average alkali content, the pH value increases due to ongoing hydration up to 13.6 already after one day and above 13.8 after 28 days. Under this condition independent from risen temperatures, a decomposition of ettringite is possible so that ettringite can no longer be detected in the structure.

The quick attainment of a high degree of hydration due to heat treatment reduces the content of the solution phase in a short time so that the process of the pH value increases in the solution phase may be accelerated. Due to this fact, the decomposition processes of ettringite and the risen sulfate contents in the pore solution after a heat treatment which are often described may be attributed to the instability of ettringite at high pH values and less to its instability at higher temperatures. Due to changes in the liquid phase in mortar or concrete during the utilization and with its decreasing pH value, a re-crystallization of ettringite is possible mainly in pores, phase transition zones, and mature parts of the micro structure. Frequent changes in moisture or a permanent water supply as well as high permeability of the microstructure and structural damages accelerate the process of leaching alkalies and promote the ettringite re-crystallization, so that ettringite is detectable in conspicuous amounts in most damaged concretes.

7. **Ettringite formation in air voids**

Despide of the chemical processes already described (additional formation of ettringite from monosulfate), the accumulation of ettringite in the air voids - e.g. in pavement concretes (fig. 16) - can lead to physical damage of the concrete microstructure during freeze-thaw attack.

Due to the fine needle-like structure of the new phases formed in the air voids which normally interrupt the capillary transport, water absorption can be increased (fig. 17) so that not only a substantially  greater  quantity  of  moisture  is  present  in  the  concrete  during  a  freeze-thaw attack, but also the room for expansion which was originally available has been restricted by the formation of new phases.

The air voids are no longer available for adequate compensation of the increase in volume which occurs during freezing as a result of the formation of ice (Stark and Bollmann [19, 20], Ouyang  and  Lane  [67]).  While  with  all  previous  investigations  into  frost/de-icing  salt resistance of concrete (CDF test) no correlation between capillary suction and frost/de-icing salt resistance was found, in case of overgrown air voids, a strong increase in the amount of scaling occurs (Fig. 18).

Caused by frost and de-icing salt attack, an internal damage of the concrete microstructure was also detected using the ultrasonic measurement method. Since after the CDF test the transfer behaviour of the microstructure has deteriorated, a strong damping of the ultrasonic signal is recorded in the frequency spectrum. As has been proven by this results, the new formation of ettringite in the hardened concrete can, in the end, imply physical effects on the frost/de-icing salt resistance of the concrete.

8. **Possible damage mechanisms**

The  question  as  to  whether  and  how  the  formation  of  ettringite  in  hardened  concrete  is involved in the damage mechanism is still in controversial discussion. Is it the cause of cracks or does it only take place preferentially in cracks which already exist?

From  the  different  theories  on  ettringite  formation  in  hardened  concrete,  described  in literature, possible damage mechanisms can be derived as follows:

- The  primary  ettringite  formation  during  the  initial  hydration  does  not  lead  to  damage, because this ettringite formation occurs in the plastic matrix and thus no stresses will be produced.
- If the ettringite formed primarily or delayed inside the microstructure is **micro-crystalline**, than in hardened concrete it may develop an **expansion pressure due to adsorption of water**, which can cause damages if the tensile strength of the microstructure is exceeded.
- Ettringite formed in the hardened concrete structure from less-sulfate containing compounds either **delayed** (due to higher temperatures during the initial hydration) or **additionally** (due to internal sulfate sources - e.g. through the affect of frost-, frost-deicing salt, through carbonation, from the clinker) may due to the **crystal growth** or due to the **increase in volume** cause stresses which exceed the tensile strength of the structure and can therefore cause damages. (The transformation of monosulfate into ettringite, for example, causes a

  2\.3-times increase in volume.)

- The **recrystallization** of ettringite in the hardened structure, due to moisture changes and accumulation of reactants, may lead to structure damages because of the **crystallization pressure** and the **increase in volume**.

Up to now it is not definitely proven whether or not the crystallization pressure during the formation  of  ettringite  or  the  expansive  pressure  caused  by  water  adsorption  on  micro- crystalline ettringite can produce cracks in a concrete microstructure, previously considered intact. There are various arguments against the “crystallization pressure“ theory. As is also described  in  [23],  certain  conditions  are  necessary  for  the  development  of  crystallization pressure during the precipitation of a phase from solution which are probably not present in the concrete for years. Another argument against the “crystallization pressure“ theory is that the width of the annular gap around the aggregate grain, and hence the thickness of the ettringite layer, is proportional to the size of the aggregate, which points to a homogeneous expansion of the matrix [23].

The question of a crack-causing ettringite formation should not be overrated because, as mentioned  above,  prior  damage  of  the  concrete  microstructure  associated  with  micro- cracking, for example, can have many causes and can never be definitely ruled out under normal conditions of production and use. However, the recrystallized ettringite in the prior present  micro-cracks  could  lead  to  constraint  of  the  deformation  caused  by  moisture, temperature, and/or load.

There  is  controversy  in  the  discussion  whether  expansion  caused  by  the  ettringite  is  the primary  cause  of  the  structure  damage  or  the  consequence  of  a  predamage  of  the microstructure. While e.g. Heinz [45] assumes that the structure damage occurs due to the growth of ettringite formations in the matrix, Scrivener and Taylor [68], Lawrence [69], Fu and Beaudoin [70, 71] assume that the structure damages occur due to other causes such as high  heat  treatment  temperatures  and  shrinkage,  for  example,  and  thus  form  optimal conditions for ettringite formation there.

Such defects in the concrete microstructure can be caused during a heat treatment due to physical effects through insufficient short prestorages and/or too fast heating and cooling. During utilization cracks can occur due to static and constructiv causes as well as internal stresses  (through  temperature  and  moisture  gradients,  freeze-thaw  cycles,  corrosion  of reinforcement, as well as through other damage reactions such as ASR). These microcracks exist in the matrix, and especially in the transition zone between hardened cement paste and aggregate. The interface between hardened cement paste and coarser aggregates is especially exposed because in this area with a thickness up to 50 µm – in contrary to the matrix - a higher porosity and an accumulation of portlandite and ettringite is set.

The  predamages  in  the  concrete  structure  can  have  manifold  causes  and  they  cannot  be excluded under common production and utilization conditions. Such defects for the present facilitate the access of water as transport medium and as reactant, therefore promoting lokal accumulations  of  ettringite  because  capillary  transport  processes  are  interruped  and  the reactants transported in the pore solution are deposited in pores and crack rims. There they react, promoted by sufficient space. Due to this, predamages of the concrete structure can promote and accelerate the damage reaction so that all influences which can cause cracks can also promote the ettringite formation in the cracks. The ettringite crystallized in these places is often not seen as cause of the damage but only as consequence. Subsequently it can lead to a constraint of deformations caused by moisture, temperature, and/or stresses. Therefore the expansion is a direct consequence of the crack enlargement. For such a crack enlargement due to ettringitte formation, much less energy is needed compared to the energy needed for the formation of new cracks in concrete.

The present findings therefore lead to the conclusion that micro damages in the structure, in connection  with  moisture  exposure,  are  the  cause  of  transport  processes  within  the microstructure  and  in  the  transfer  with  the  surroundings.  They  promote  changes  in  the composition of the pore solution and with it the conditions for a recrystallization of coarse- crystalline  ettringite.  Thus,  microdamages  are  often  the  pre-condition  and  not  the consequence of the ettringite formation in hardened concrete.

Following mechanisms were derived from the results of our investigations:

- With  the  common  high  pH-values  in  the  matrix  the  primary  formed  ettringite  is  not detectable. A decrease of the pH-value is necessary for a recrystallization of ettringite in the hardened concrete, e.g. by leaching of alkalis or by other pH-reducing reactions such as ASR.
- Predamages existing in the microstructure promote subsequently, due to increased moisture and phase transport, in availability of internal sulfate sources the ettringite formation at these exposed places and cracks were enlarged.
- The ettringite recrystallized in the entrained air voids can indirectly lead to frost damages because the air voids lose its effectiveness regarding the frost-deicing salt resistance.
- It can not be excluded that ettringite is often not involved in the damage mechanism and thus only a consequence of the microstructure damage caused by other processes.

The  ettringite  formation  can  be  restricted  by  latent  hydraulic  and/or  pozzolanic  additives which, combined with calcium (e.g. blast furnace slag, silica fume or fly ash from hard coal). Ca(OH)2 is then consumed with the formation of additional calcium silicate hydrate, reducing the pore volume and consolidating the microstructure, especially in the regions around the aggregates. This restricts the damage promoting transport of moisture and phase-forming components in the concrete [72,73].

9. **Summary**

Concrete damage in conjunction with the formation of ettringite in hardened concrete is the result  of  complex  long-term  processes  in  which  the  concrete  composition,  technological factors during concrete production, and the effects of the surroundings are important. With preventive measures it is therefore not sufficient to take into account only one influencing factor, such as the chemical composition of the cement. All factors which lead to disruption and damage of the microstructure can also promote the formation of ettringite in hardened concrete. The occurrence of large ettringite crystals in concrete cracks is, as a rule, only a consequence and rarely the cause of the cracks.
