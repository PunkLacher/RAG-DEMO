Although far more common than they once were, pools with vanishing edges are still among the watershaping industry’s most distinctive designs. Their increased popularity, however, has been accompanied by a rash of expensive repairs and structural failures in the walls used to create the edge effects.  To get to the bottom of this disturbing trend, engineer Ron Lacher has investigated the causes and, in this article, presents his rec- ommendations for solutions. ![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.003.png)

lems. Now we were hearing about issues with walls finished in stone and tile — and the concern was always primarily about the weir walls.

It had to be something else, so we started digging deeper.

Material Insight

For the longest time,I was at a loss to explain these failures. I knew it wasn t the surface material,because by now we were seeing situations in which surfaces finished in combinations oftile and ex- posed aggregate — as in cases where the edge itself is covered in tile while the wall below is finished in some other ma- terial — were experiencing failures with *both*surfaces.

I began to notice that these problems were similar to those I d seen in the dam walls ofraised spas and in pools built into ascending slopes with overly irrigated landscaping above them. Moreover,we were now seeing projects where water was leaking all the way through the weir wall — clearly not a problem related to *any* surface finish.

All the evidence began pointing to a conclusion that the issue had to do with water *behind*a wall structure that had an exposed surface on the opposite side.

This problem wasn t happening in all vanishing-edge pools,however,so we soon recognized that the water was merely exacerbating some other prob- lem (or perhaps a combination ofprob- lems). At its core,the challenge had to be  coming  from  water  penetrating through weir walls.

Backing up a bit,at this point it s im- portant to note that the cementitious surface materials used in swimming pools are not completely waterproof. The Technical Manual of the National Plasterers Council, for example, de- scribes plaster,the most familiar of all pool and spa surfacing materials,as a

` `semi-permeable membrane. 

This is not new information. The sim- ple fact is,without some other means of waterproofing or the use ofadmixtures, all cement-based materials will allow some water to penetrate their surfaces. They may be said to be  water-resistant, but they certainly are not waterproof.

It took a while, but eventually pat- terns emerged that helped us determine why these freestanding weir walls were failing – and what needed to be done to prevent it.

tershapes installed in the ground — that is,where the walls are backed by earth — this semi-permeability isn t an issue be- cause no harm is done when small amounts of water penetrate the struc- ture. Usually,this volume ofwater is so small that it pales in significance to loss- es due to evaporation,so nobody ever gives it a thought.

That all changes when we consider freestanding walls such as those we set up in vanishing-edge pools. Here,the level of permeability obviously can be- come a problem.

Going Deeper

To get to the bottom of the mystery, we began examining a range of issues that might be coming into play — every- thing from workmanship techniques and the porosity ofthe materials used in weir walls to the physical nature of the walls relative to temperature differen- tials and the presence ofmoisture mov- ing through the wall. In all cases,we were![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.010.png)

looking for ways in which these issues might be driving the failure rate.

Efflorescence is one such issue and is thought to be one ofthe primary fac- tors in the cycle of weir-wall deterio- ration. Efflorescence is the simple for- mation of salt crystals through the evaporation of salt-bearing water. As water passes through a semi-perme- able weir wall,salts remaining from the cement s hydration process are dis- solved and carried by water as it moves through the structure.

Upon reaching the surface,the water evaporates and leaves behind the miner- als — and thereby the evidence ofwater s transmission through the semi-perme- able weir wall. As this process continues, salt crystals can build up in the pores and voids in the material and can eventually fracture (or *spall*) the surface. We stop this damaging effect ofefflorescence by keeping water from passing through the weir wall in the first place. (More on this solution later on.)    

Moving beyond that issue,we knew that weir walls were different from oth- er pool structures in that they are exposed to extremes with respect to moisture changes and temperature variations — factors known to cause problems in the broader concrete-construction industry.

One consequence of exposing con- crete surfaces to environmental condi- tions is the phenomenon known as  curling.  More commonly an issue with concrete flatwork,curling happens when there are differences in the mois- ture level between the top and bottom of a concrete slab.

We all know that concrete shrinks as it dries and expands when moist. Ifyou have a four-inch-thick concrete slab,for example,and the top surface is exposed to the atmosphere while the bottom is exposed to a moist subgrade,the top will dry faster than the bottom and the dif- ference in the rate ofshrinkage will cause the structure s shape to distort with its ends  curling upward.

This same phenomenon can cause ![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.011.png)problems with the surface material on vanishing-edge weir walls when the back of the surface material is exposed to moisture penetrating the weir wall as the wall s front surface is exposed to the air. The stresses from curling can be tremen- dous and will expose any weakness of the bond between the surface material and the gunite or shotcrete substrate. 

Another phenomenon is known as 

` `warping, which is similar to curling but relates to concrete s expansion in response to heat. Basically,when one side is ex- posed to heat — as in the case ofthe out- side surface material on a weir wall — the outside part ofthe material expands rel- ative to the inside of the material and bows upward in the center. 

The possible result of curling or warping is delamination or cracking in ![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.012.png)

While these recommendations apply to

every concrete pool ever made,they are of even greater importance on weir walls,where workmanship defects are more likely to reveal themselves — often in dramatic fashion.

The discussion of standards begins with a look at the pairing ofconcrete and rebar. As with all reinforced structures, the rebar must be completely encased in concrete,otherwise the structure is not effectively reinforced and the voids will allow moisture to travel through the structure and cause the rebar to rust.

Again,this is not new information,but in the case ofa freestanding wall,it s ab- solutely critical that proper construction procedures be followed to ensure com- plete rebar encasement. First,the re- bar must not vibrate or move as the con- crete is being shot — and that the forms should be equally stable. Any movement might create voids around the rebar that will give water a place to gather and cause rust to form. Once rust begins to form,

![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.014.png)

expansion pressure builds and can lead to reflective cracking,spalling and the buildup ofefflorescence.

In the case of weir walls,I m not ex- aggerating to say that violations of this standard are commonplace. All too of- ten, I see crews install forms by tying them directly to the rebar with no spac- ers or dobies at all between the rebar and the form. What this means is that the rebar is,in effect,going to end up at or just below the surface ofthe concrete and will not be fully and completely encased.

With failed surfaces,the removal of the surface material often reveals struc- tures in which the rebar is right there, visible on the gunite or shotcrete surface and without the required coverage.

Given this practice,there s little won- der why so many walls are failing: The rebar simply isn t properly encased in concrete!  The good news is,the fix is obvious: Build stable rebar cages, tie them together properly,construct sta-

Sprayed On![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.016.png)

The issue,however,isn t all with rebar and forms: Of equal importance is a range of concerns having to do with proper gunite or shotcrete application. This is a huge topic and merits separate discussion;for our purposes here,a few key points will suffice.

The first has to do with  shadowing. When concrete is shot into place,the nozzle operator must be certain that there s no shadow behind the rebar — that is,the sort ofvoid that results when cor- rect application techniques are not be- ing followed. Just as is the case when re- bar vibrates during shotcrete application, the voids formed by shadowing lead to familiar problems with water movement, rust,cracking and efflorescence.

Workmanship plays a definite role in these problems with weir walls.  Situations in which cages are inadequately securedand are able to move during shotcrete application are trouble (A), for example, as are instances in which no spacers are used to make certain rebar can be fully and completely encapsulated in con- crete (B).  The consequences in the latter case show up as soon as the forms are stripped (C) – and the situation only gets worse when water is introduced.   

A B Proper shotcrete-application techniques are important in![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.017.png)![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.018.png)

ate angle and in ways that minimize over-spray and the creation of rebound (B).  Neither over-spray nor rebound are ever fully reliable material – and they are particularly troublesome in freestanding weir walls (C&D), where their presence can encourage water passage and speed a wall’s deterioration.

Another issue is over-spray and rebound. Very often,I ve ![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.019.png)seen applicators who are  stack shooting a wall — that is,build- ing the wall up with successive passes — allow over-spray and rebound to build up against the form,especially ifthe applica- tion surface isn t at a 45-degree angle. Maintaining the appli- cation surface at this 45-degree angle helps minimize the en- trapment of over-spray and rebound. Proper workmanship dictates that after each pass,the crew needs to go back and clear away this over-spray and rebound;otherwise,the next pass sim- ply locks loose material into the wall. 

This is not an uncommon occurrence,of course,because clearing away the over-spray and rebound is laborious and time-consuming. But the outcome can be problematic,as in the walls ofinground pools where you see over-spray and re- bound lurking at the top ofthe wall or in the bond beam — and coping is subsequently mounted atop poor-quality material. 

As has been discussed in a previous article ( Bad Benchmarks,  August 2006,page 42),over-spray and rebound are also a huge problem in benches and steps,but they are equally problemat- 

ic in weir walls,where the resulting imperfect structure is ex- posed to extremes of temperature and moisture differentials. ![](Aspose.Words.8caff9f5-43d1-47e5-88bf-f0e86c2482f4.020.png)Indeed,this single mistake ofleaving over-spray and rebound in the weir wall structure can result in failures that might start slowly with minor cracking and efflorescence but can later de- velop into leaks and other serious problems. 

Curing — that is,properly wetting the surface after it s been shot — is another basic step that s ofextreme importance with weir walls. We all know that when concrete cures too quickly,it is sub- ject to the formation ofshrinkage cracks. When weir walls are exposed to direct sunlight,they can heat up quickly and,ifnot properly wetted after concrete application,will develop shrink- age cracks that aggravate the problems we ve been discussing. 

Waterproofing 

In addition to basic practices that should be applied anyway, weir walls must also be given the added protection ofsome form ofwaterproofing — at least on the inside but preferably on both the inside and outside surfaces.
