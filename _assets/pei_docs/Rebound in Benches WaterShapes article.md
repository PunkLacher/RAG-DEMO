Evidence ofthese trans- gressions is found most often on the steps and benches inside spas and shows up mainly in the form ofdelaminations that result in unsightly plaster cracks. 

Tell-Tale Cracks 

Through the years,my work as a struc- tural engineer has involved the inspec- tion ofhundreds offailed swimming pool and spa structures. These cracks on spa 

Saw-cutting the damaged area of this spa bench made it possible to flick off a piece of the plaster and discover the disaster lurking beneath the hard shell.  It s rare even in cas- es of step or bench failure to find junk so sandy that you can plunge a finger into it with ease. ![ref1]

benches are definitely one of the most ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.004.png)![ref1]common problems I see. 

Before I am called to a site,the problem more often than not is seen as a plaster de- fect,and it has generally been the plaster- ing contractor who has gotten the initial call from an upset pool builder whose client is demanding an immediate fix. The truth,however,is that the plaster is rarely the culprit in these situations. 

Yes,there are cases when cracking ex- tends from some sort of plaster delami- nation,but that is the case in only a mi- nor percentage ofthe cases I ve examined. Far more commonly,the problem extends from unreliable concrete *beneath*the plas- ter. Time and time again,chipping away the plaster layer reveals a gunite sub- 

structure that literally crumbles at the ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.005.png)touch — even though this material should be able to resist damage of a solid blow by a hammer. 

It bears mentioning that,in many cas- es,the plaster is the only thing holding the step or bench together,even though it is intended as a waterproofing membrane and not a structural element. It should also be noted that,in a vast majority ofcases, the problem occurs in pools and spas that were built using gunite rather than shot- crete,a distinction I ll get to later. 

Further investigation reveals the plain truth that the concrete under the cracked steps and benches had nowhere near the required 2,000-psi strength and that even- tual failure was inevitable. 

In many cases,this defect in basic con- ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.006.png)struction is seen when plaster is removed from the shell for repair or refinishing. Once the plaster is stripped away,signif- icant parts ofthe steps and benches sim- ply fall apart,necessitating complete re- installation. The problem here is that the person on the job at that point is a plas- ter applicator who has absolutely noth- ing to do with installing gunite. 

This is when the rounds offinger point- ing begin and the homeowner faces the hellish experience oftrying to get the spa reworked,perhaps many years after ini- tial construction. These situations are bad for everyone involved,and cases such as these have been a real black eye for the pool and spa industry for many years. 

Placing Blame ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.007.png)

The timing of these incidents often leads to wild and desperate conjecture about the nature ofthe problem. 

Because these types offailures occur most commonly in spas,for example,there is of- ten a presumption that warm water has something to do with the failures. This leads gunite applicators to point the finger at the quality ofthe plaster job or,in some cases,at aggressive water chemistry. The 

The origin of the problem seems obvious: It has to do with the use of gunite rebound in shaping steps and benches.  This material has no structural value in a watershape s shell: It should be gathered up and discarded — no exceptions! 

Inside Rebound![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.008.png)![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.009.png)

Aside from it being a waste product of pneumatic application, what’s wrong with us- ing rebound as a structural material?  

Think of a baseball that’s been coated with cement and thrown very fast against a rigid wall.  The result is that the baseball ricochets off the rigid wall but, as this happens, a sub- stantial amount of the cement that coated the ball becomes splattered against the wall. The ball, now lacking a good part of its ce- ment coating, falls to the most convenient landing spot.  

Similarly with gunite and shotcrete, a por- tion of the  high velocity shot material – pri- marily the larger aggregates – ricochets or rebounds off the receiving surface and lands on the nearest horizontal plane.  ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.010.png)

The key point of this comparison is that, like the ball, the “rebound” aggregate has lost a substantial amount of its cement and is therefore no longer viable as a structural ma- terial.  This is so widely recognized that, in fact, uniform building codes do not permit the use of rebound in structures.

— R.L.

This newly shot shell shows the tell-tale signs of rebound use.  The rebound-filled top sur- face may be capable of holding its shape un- til it is encapsulated in plaster, but if it is bumped or disturbed, it will crumble and fall away.  Again, this isn t a competent substrate for plaster and should never be used.

latter is an amazing charge,the supposed culprit being low-pH water that penetrates the plaster and somehow attacks the gunite substrate,thereby weakening the structure and causing the cracking.

My amazement with the aggressive-wa- ter allegation comes from the fact that when you strip away the plaster,the loose gunite is often bone dry. And anyway, how could aggressive water destroy the gunite beneath plaster without destroy- ing the plaster as well?  Both materials are made ofPortland cement and both typ- ically have a high in-place pH,so the ex-

planation simply makes no sense.

I ve confirmed this opinion with Dr. Damian Kachlakev,Ph.D.,P.E.,who di- rects the National Pool Industry Research Center at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo,Calif. One of his current research projects is about the durability of pool-surface coatings and aggressive pool water. As he puts it,  It is clear that the reason for the delam- ination is not aggressive water chemistry of the swimming pools or pool surface imperfections,but sheer deficiency ofthe gunite material. 

But this leaves us with a couple of key questions: Why mostly spa steps and benches?  Why mostly gunite and not shotcrete?  Why the weak concrete? 

After-the-fact examinations reveal that the cracking is caused by bad concrete, but that doesn t tell the whole story. This is why,for the past several years,I ve made a point of watching gunite installations all over the country whenever I can — pay- ing particular attention when spa steps and benches are being installed.

Answering the Call 

There s good news and bad news in this discussion. 

The good news is that the fix is simple: Don t use rebound to form steps or benches anywhere in a pool/spa shell — end ofdiscussion!  

The bad news is that this practice is so common in the industry that it s hard to imagine things changing without some sort ofconcerted information campaign and increased education in workmanship and good construction practices. The simple ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.013.png)fact is that there is a right way to apply con- crete and that guidance in doing so is avail- able from the American Concrete Institute and the American Shotcrete Association. 

I ve recently been appointed to the Pool 

&  Spa  Committee  of the American Shotcrete Association. The goal of this committee is to develop a guide on pool- construction practice,and it is hoped that in the not-too-distant future,the faulty practice discussed in these pages (along with others that may be discussed in fu- ture issues) will no longer be so frequent a cause of costly repairs and dissatisfied pool owners. 

My purpose here is to make designers and builders aware of these issues and to urge everyone to make certain their subcontractors are observing proper ![](Aspose.Words.ec1f76a6-3e56-48c2-9661-4738111e451a.014.png)workmanship standards on all fronts — particularly when it comes to the prop- er discarding ofrebound. 

It s the right way to get an important job done. 

Evidence of the use of rebound often shows up years later, when a watershape s interi- or plaster is stripped for refinishing.  In all of these cases, the rebound-bearing steps and benches fell apart once the plaster that held them together was removed, leaving the homeowners and plasterers with messes that won t just take care of themselves — and the watershaping industry with a black eye it really doesn t need.
