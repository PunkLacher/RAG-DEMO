**S PART OF our specialized practice in structural engineering for swimming pools, we are often asked to investigate all sorts of pool-related problems to determine the cause. Over the years, we’ve learned many valuable lessons from these investigations, particularly on the topic of hillside pool construction and the construction of pools near descending slopes.** 

Pools experience serious structural distress most frequently when  ![](Aspose.Words.2f156135-6515-44ad-9036-cb883f8dc40d.002.png)![ref1]

they are located near descending slopes. The natural occurrence of  

“slope creep” causes the majority of these failures. Hillside areas are  

a popular location for swimming pools and that, combined with the  

frequency of hillside pools experiencing distress, makes slope creep  

the  single  most  common  cause  of  structural  distress  resulting  in  

costly repair and mitigation. 

The typical pool structure is a thin-walled concrete shell designed  

to resist the pressure of the surrounding soil, much like a retaining  

wall. A properly-designed retaining wall must be built upon a foun- 

dation or footing that is supported by firm soil. In the case of a swim- 

ming pool, the fl oor of the pool serves as the foundation or footing.  **Cracking from diff erential settlement.**

But a pool varies from a retaining wall in that it often holds 200,000 ![](Aspose.Words.2f156135-6515-44ad-9036-cb883f8dc40d.003.png)pounds or more of water in addition to the pressure from surround- ing soil. If the soil under a portion of the pool doesn’t support the pool, that area of the pool will settle. When a portion of the pool settles while the remainder of the pool is properly supported and does not settle, it is called differential settlement – which frequently results in cracking of the pool.

A number of soil and geotechnical issues will result in differen- tial settlement. By far, the greatest percentage of differential settle- ment-related structural distress is caused by slope creep, which can occur when pools are located near descending slopes.

**Slope Creep**

When clay soil becomes wet, it tends to swell like a sponge – this is called “expansive soil.” And when expansive soil absorbs moisture and swells, it moves. On level ground, it heaves or moves upward. If the ground is sloped, expansive soil moves upward and sideways. When expansive soil dries, it shrinks back almost to its original size. When descending slopes containing expansive soil experience repeated cycles of wetting and drying over time, that and the force of gravity results in an ongoing movement or creep of soil down the face of the slope. Creep is slow, nearly continuous, and has a pro- gressive effect that can reach a downhill rate of 1/4 inch per year.

Soil  moisture  content  tends  to  become  more  uniform  with increasing depth; that is, without wetting and drying cycles. The weight of overlying soil also tends to reduce the amount of vol- ume change that can occur. Therefore, the deeper the soil, the less

eight feet of soil on a slope. The typical manu- ![](Aspose.Words.2f156135-6515-44ad-9036-cb883f8dc40d.005.png)factured slope today is graded at one foot verti- cal to two feet horizontal. This means that slope creep can affect structures and other improve- ments 10 to 16 feet or more from the top of a descending slope.

Slope  creep  can  be  particularly  brutal  to swimming pools and associated improvements. 

If the soil under a portion of the pool doesn’t support the pool, that area of the pool will settle 

and crack. If a pool is located in an area contain- **Side property line walls will crack**  ing expansive soil and within the zone subject to **usually 10 to 15 ft. from the slope.** slop e creep, the portion of the pool within the

creep zone will lose support and settle, rotate, and crack as a result of slope creep. Once the cracking begins, water leaking from the pool typically exacerbates the problem.

**Resisting the Effects of Slope Creep**

The International Building Code requires that swimming pools constructed on or near descending  slopes  be  built  differently  than pools built in level yards. These building code provisions, in Section 1805.3, have two very specific but differing requirements for pools built  near  descending  slopes.  Both  of  these requirements must be met. 

The fi rst is **1805.3.3 Pools.** That portion of the pool wall within a horizontal distance of seven feet from the top of the slope shall be capable of supporting the water in the pool without soil support.

A common term used in the pool indus- try,  “freestanding wall,”  is synonymous with the code language “capable of supporting the water in the pool without soil support.” 

Although 7 ft. is the code-required distance from the top of the slope where freestanding walls are required, it is highly recommended 

that a greater distance such as 10 ft. or more be utilized in practice.

The second is **1805.3.2 - footing setback from descending slope surface.** Footings on or adjacent to slope surfaces shall be founded in  firm  material  with  an  embedment  and setback  from  the  slope  surface  sufficient  to provide  vertical  and  lateral  support  for  the footing without detrimental settlement. The foundation of the pool (the bottom) must be set back from the face of the slope a distance equal to the total height of the slope divided by six. The International Building Code does not  specify  a  minimum  foundation  setback. However, experience has proven that a mini- mum of 15 ft. or greater is recommended.

Don’t  overlook  the  requirement  that  the footing (pool bottom) must be founded in firm material suffi cient to provide vertical and lateral support. How can you be assured that this is the case? We recommend that pool contractors building pools on or near a descending slope obtain the services of a geotechnical engineer to address the all-important geotechnical issues. This becomes even more critical when the pro- posed pool site is in an area where the original

site grading was not supervised and certified by a professional geotechnical consultant.  

**Increasing the Foundation Setback**

If  a  swimming  pool  is  proposed  near  a descending slope, the risk of building in that location  can  be  reduced  by  increasing  the foundation setback. The foundation setback can be increased either by deepening the pool or by the construction of a footing or key under the outermost wall of the pool near the descending slope. If the descending slope is graded at two feet horizontal to one foot vertical, each added foot of pool depth or footing depth will add two feet to the foundation setback. If the descending slope  is  graded  at  1.5  feet  horizontal  to  one foot vertical, each added foot of pool depth or footing depth will add 1.5 feet to the foundation setback.

**Other Precautions**

Repeated cycles of wetting and drying will result in creep of soil down the face of the slope. Therefore, it is important to maintain moisture content of the soils on and adjacent to the slope as relatively constant as possible. 

Surface  and  subsurface  drainage  must  be carefully installed and maintained to minimize 

ponding of water near the top of the descend- ing slope. Irrigation systems should be adjusted to provide the minimum water needed to sus- tain  landscaping  and  prevent  excessive  dry- ing of the soils. Both over watering and under watering of landscape areas must be avoided. Landscaping must not obstruct the drainage pattern or cause surface water to collect near the descending slope. Elevated planters adja- cent to the slope should be lined with a mem- brane  to  minimize  the  penetration  of  water into the adjacent sub-grade. 

Gophers  and  other  rodents  should  be removed as their burrows provide easy entry of surface water that will saturate the slope.

Some  of  the  most  stunning  locations  for swimming pools are in hillside areas. By being fully informed of the critical issues we’ve dis- cussed and implementing the requirements and recommendations into the planning and con- struction, swimming pools can be safely built in hillside locations.
