The combination ofconcrete and steel is the currency of most modern con- struction,and there s a simple economic explanation for that fact: The affordabil- ity and availability of the basic ingredi- ents of cement,aggregate,water and re- bar have made their combination viable for use in countries the world over.

Used together,especially when the ce- mentitious product comes in the form of pneumatically applied concrete, rein- forced concrete is incredibly flexible and can be used to create almost any shape we might imagine. And in the case ofpneu- matic application,those shapes can large- ly be created without the use oftraditional concrete forms.

Indeed,it s a construction matrix that can be used in such a way that the con- tours of the soil dictate the shape of the structure,giving the watershaper almost unlimited flexibility. It s even fair to say that pneumatically applied concrete, properly reinforced with steel,has made the true art ofwatershaping possible — es- pecially when we re discussing inground pools and spas.

For all that flexibility and myriad oth- er advantages,however,problems and even structural failures can occur with concrete structures. That s why it s keen- ly important for all watershapers to un- derstand the physical nature ofthese ma- terials and,more to the point,how these characteristics relate to the science and mathematics that underlie building codes and why they are so crucial to achieving reliable project results.

Tracing a Revolution

Let s begin with an important distinc- tion: As far as building codes are con- cerned these days,pneumatically applied concrete is known as  shotcrete, a desig-

Concrete Institute in the early 1970s. This

No one knows for certain who was first to see the potential ofpneumatically ap- plied concrete in the construction of swimming pools and other watershapes or exactly when it occurred. I ve heard claims and counterclaims through the years and won t step into these disputa- tions here,but what I do know is that once gunite and shotcrete began to be used in shaping swimming pool shells,the in- dustry was revolutionized and pools tru- ly became available to the masses.

Made to Order

One of the keys to the success and ac- ceptance of gunite and shotcrete is that they contain relatively little moisture when compared to some poured-in-place forms ofconcrete. That s important,because it is generally true that the more water there is in the mix,the lower will be the grade of the concrete. So when compared to poured-in-place concrete, gunite and shotcrete can be made to be relatively strong and comparatively durable.

This is so because the evaporation of moisture from the concrete matrix leaves voids — and the greater the number of voids,the lower the structural integrity and strength. In addition,the voids make the concrete subject to chemical attack and less resistant to physical stress. (None ofthis alters the fact that the exposed sur- faces of*all*setting concrete materials — poured-in-place,shotcrete or gunite — must be bathed in water to allow for prop- er curing!)

Beyond their competitive edges with respect to strength and durability,both shotcrete and gunite have distinct ad- vantages over poured-in-place concrete because they hold their shapes once ap- plied — and once again those advantages are  related to moisture content. This shape-holding potential is there because pneumatically applied materials exhibit very little *slump*,which is defined as the distance concrete will fall when placed while wet in the shape ofa cone.

(Anyone who s been in the watershap- ing business for any length oftime knows that if the nozzle operator applies too much water in a gunite application,the wall can fall down,often a costly,time-

Steel does a fantastic job of reinforcing when it is set up and tied to allow for proper pneumatic application of concrete.  In these two cases, however, steel s ability is severely compromised by improper lapping that very often results in the creation of voids as the concrete is applied.

that these two materials,when combined, take advantage of each other s strengths while offsetting each other s weakness- es. For its part,concrete is wonderful at resisting pressure in the form of *com- pression*,but conversely is weak in tension. Reinforcing steel,by contrast,is great at resisting loads present in the form of*ten- sion* but,because of its typically narrow profile,has a tendency to buckle in the presence of compressive forces (and is therefore said to be limited with respect to compression).

When you combine the good charac- teristics ofeach,you have a material that provides great strength in both areas. This is why,when you look at a structural plan for a concrete structure,it will invariably include specifics for both the diameter of the reinforcing steel (as indicated by its number designation) and the thickness ofthe gunite encasing it.

A typical steel specification for a rein- forced-concrete inground pool,for ex- ample,will call for  grade 40 deformed bars conforming to ASTM Standard A- 615.  The *grade*of the steel is a measure of its yield strength: If you place the bar in a machine and pull on it,the *yield point* represents the pressure required to stretch the bar and change its shape.

This is a point at which the material is no longer in an *elastic*state in which it stretches but then returns to its original shape when the pressure is removed. When you pass the yield point,the ma- terial instead becomes *plastic* and will *not* return to its original shape. That is con- sidered failure ofthe material. The yield point for grade 40 steel is 40,000 psi;for grade 60,it s 60,000 psi;and for grade 75, it s 75,000 psi. These are the most com- monly used grades ofsteel.

What gives steel its strength is not so much its diameter as it is the area of a cross-section — and it is this area upon which building officials rely in devel- oping their codes. Thus,if you have re- bar with a yield strength of 40,000 psi and a working stress of 20,000 psi (as dictated by building codes), you mul- tiply that capacity by the area ofthe bar, which in #3 rebar is 0.11 inches. This calculation gives you a load-carrying capacity of about 2,000 pounds of working stress.

It has to do with achieving a certain  psi ofconcrete.

What we re considering here is the material s ability to withstand com- pression as measured in pounds per square inch (psi). If you were to take a core out of a swimming pool s wall, put it in a test stand and press it until it broke, the strength of the material would be a function of the area being pressed (measured in square inches) di- vided by the pressure required to pro- duce the breakage.

For concrete  rated at 2,000 psi,for example,a core measuring four square inches in surface area should support 8,000 pounds of pressure before break- ing. (In effect,this is the  yield strength ofthe concrete.)  In designing structures, engineers are permitted by code to ex- ploit only 45% of that strength — again ensuring a wide margin ofsafety against structural failure. That means with 2,000 psi concrete we re designing around a load of just 900 psi.

As mentioned above,the strength of the concrete is determined by the pro- portion ofthe cement to aggregate and by the cement-to-water ratio. Thus (to simplify a very complex topic),the more cement and the less water, the higher the strength ofthe concrete is said to be (see Table I on page 58).

The 2,000-psi minimum-strength re- quirement commonly found in swim- ming pools and other watershapes is not a high standard compared to some oth- er concrete applications. In high rises,for example,where load-bearing capacity is critical relative to the weight of the con- crete,the mixes become very precise and so sophisticated so that they can achieve levels upwards of 10,000 psi. (In these very-high-end applications,a variety of plasticizers and admixtures are used to achieve the required strength.)

Even so,some gunite vessels built in accordance with the 2,000-psi specifi- cation will fail,despite the relative ease of achieving that rating. Often,subse- quent testing reveals that the gunite did not rise to that standard,in which case the logical conclusion is that, to save money, the applicators failed to use enough cement relative to the amount ofwater and aggregate needed to achieve

It is extremely important to encase reinforcing steel in adequately thick layers of concrete.  As the photo that opens this article shows (page 54), steel set in shallow concrete will fail in dramatic ways. When such vessels are stripped for repairs, the true extent of the disaster is plainly seen.
