Despite the apparent intricacy of any good set of engineering drawings and contrary to what many people think, structural plans for concrete watershapes are pretty cut and dried.

At the most basic level,the art and sci- ence ofstructural engineeringdeals with predictable forces placed upon structures and with the construction techniques and materials required to counteract those forces. The basic mathematic calculations are straightforward stuff,and everything runs in accordance with building codes that define permitted stresses in the materials and the methodology ofthe calculations.

Working together,it s the goal ofengi- neers,contractors and inspectors to de- vise structural details that accommodate the dynamic relationships between the structure and the ground and to have all that hard work be completely forgotten once the project is finished. In the world ofstructural engineering,in other words, you might say that success is measured by enduring obscurity.

Unfortunately,however,that sort ofob- scurity is not always achieved. I ve per- formed hundreds of investigations into causes ofa variety ofstructural failures in which engineering and construction are anything but forgotten because the con- crete structure that was supposed to be permanent has instead failed in some way. In the text to follow,let s take a look at how and why this happens by way of defining a need for greater awareness of what good structural engineering is all about.

Engineering’s Role

Plainly stated,structural engineers who participate in watershaping projects are there to prevent system failures.

We do so by creating plans that use mathematical principles to determine physical configurations of construction materials and define a range of specific workmanship issues that come into play. How well contractors and subcontractors follow those recommendations will de-

termine whether the watershape s struc-

ture will need to be reconsidered under

negative circumstances — or can be for-

gotten completely as homeowners and

their guests are left to enjoy the water.

Through the years,I ve seen just about

every common failure you can imagine

- and a bunch of uncommon ones,too.

I ve also heard every line in the book from

contractors who are trying to cover their

tails,including the all-too-popular per- ![](Aspose.Words.98baccbd-2e8c-4654-87e5-a18b13cc0832.003.png)

could park my truck on this thing. I m 

sure it s just fine.  

Let me state for the record that a struc- 

ture s ability to support an S10 pickup has 

nothing to do with how well it will bear up Structural

under the stresses imposed by ground and

ther that any contractor without qualifi- engineering is water through the years. Let me state fur-

Structural engineering is not something

you can  eyeball and reasonably hope for and reasonably success. Instead, it requires an under-

concrete work individually and of how hope for 

standing ofhow steel reinforcement and

to read plans and have detailed knowledge success. 

they work together. It requires an ability

ofworkmanship standards. And it calls

for a good,conceptual grasp ofthe basic

forces working against inground structures

and how those forces are counteracted us-

ing steel reinforcement and concrete.

In this context,we all need to understand

why these two materials,among all avail-

able construction materials,are so com-

monly paired in man-made structures.

Here s the key: Concrete is very good at

withstanding compression, but it s far

weaker in resisting tension and pulling. By

contrast,steel reinforcement is strong in

pulling and tension,but is much weaker

under compression because it tends to

buckle as a result ofits thin profile.

When you *combine*these two materi-

als,you have a structure that can withstand

stress from both compression *and*tension

(meaning it won t bend under compres-

sion or pull apart under tension). This

Forces of Nature

What are these forces that must be withstood?  I personally believe that it s impossible to build swimming pools ef- fectively and reliably unless you know the

answers to that question and have a work- ing understanding ofthe forces that can damage or destroy an inground structure, including soil pressure,adjacent structure surcharges,subsurface water pressure,un- suitable soil and earthquakes.

- Soil pressure: Because vertical pool

walls must *always*withstand the weight or pressure of the surrounding soil,it s fair to say that soil is the single greatest determinant ofthe structure.

When considering soil,the most crit- ical factor is its expansiveness,a function measured in  equivalent fluid pressure, or EFP. As commonly used,EFP relates to the pressure asserted by water the deep- er you descend into it and is simply the weight ofthe water above as measured at 62.4 pounds per cubic foot (pcf). In oth- er words,ifyou re down at eight feet un- der water,the water s weight above you will be in excess of300 pounds per square foot (psf).

A long time ago,soils engineers deter- mined that pressure against retaining

ONCE THIS POOLhad been emptied of water as part of a renovation, the water in the surrounding soil caused the shell to float up and literally ‘pop’ out of the ground – testimony to the amazing subsurface pressures that sometimes impose themselves on concrete shells.

THE BUILDER’Slack of awareness of the unsuitability of this soil resulted in a classic case of differential settlement – in this instance,one that had a dev- astating effect on the decking at one end of the pool.

walls and other structures located in the ground could be measured using this fa- miliar fluid pressure as a model. That may be confusing to some people because soil is not a fluid for the most part,but it all works in basically the same way.

If you look at non-expansive soil,for example,it might exert 30 pcf by com- parison to water s 62.4 pounds. Ifyou go down that same eight feet and stack up the soil,you would experience the pres- sure at 240 psf.

Ifyou consider a pool wall,the EFP at the *top*would be 30 pcf,which will assert 30 psfagainst the surface area ofthe out- er wall. Go down a foot,and the pressure in typical non-expansive soil will increase to 60 pounds — increasing by increments of 30 pounds for each foot you descend along the surface ofthe pool wall. When you get to the bottom ofan eight-and-a- half foot wall,that structure,at the bot- tom,will have to be able to withstand an EFP of 270 psf.

The pressure climbs dramatically in ex- pansive soil,where a typical EFP rating

would hit 45 pcf. For *highly*expansive soil,the EFP might climb as high as 125 pcf. This is basic stuff,but already we can see that highly expansive soil could place upwards of *four times*the pressure on a pool than would be experienced with a non-expansive soil.

That difference in force must be ac- commodated,typically by increasing both the thickness ofthe concrete shell and the size and frequency ofthe steel reinforce- ment used within it.

◗Architectural surcharges: Count- erbalancing the surcharges imposed by architectural structures set up near a watershape is calculated differently from EFP,but the engineering work is done with the exact same goal in mind ofac- commodating whatever downward or lateral pressure is being applied to the shell.

The watershape s structure ultimately must withstand *all*ofthe pressure placed upon it,in other words,so in addition to considering soil you must also factor in the weight ofany adjacent structure that

exerts pressure on the shell, such as a house,a retaining wall,rock waterfalls, grottos,waterline rockwork,slides,wood- deck foundations or any number ofoth- er common structures. In these cases,the engineering computations become far more complex — and so do the construc- tion details in some cases.

◗Water pressure: Another key force that comes into play in developing en- gineering plans for a watershape is the force exerted by water — an issue that must be taken into account in two sep- arate ways.

First, there is the issue of the water contained within the structure itself — which is an issue in the case of a free- standing pool wall on a slope,for exam- ple. In such a case,there s no soil press- ing from the outside ofthe wall;instead, it s the weight and pressure ofthe water within the vessel that must be calculat- ed and accommodated.

Second, there s sometimes pressure from ground water outside the shell. It s well known that this pressure — widely re-

As this series of articles unfolds, I ll be focusing on several specific construction de- tails and common mistakes.  Here we see one of the most common problems of all: lapped steel. 

In most construction codes, it s clearly spelled out that you must have 2-1/2 inch- es of space between parallel bars.  When you lap bars together (as shown in the pho- to), you create a situation in which the gunite cannot fill in behind the bars, creating  shadows  and empty pockets that compromise the structure.

eye can sometimes tell what s going on simply by looking at the soil once the hole has been dug,there are many problems that aren t so easily apparent,and I would advise against trying to make those de- terminations on your own.

In the real world,ifyou have any sort of reason at all to believe that you are dealing with unsuitable soils,it is criti- cal to obtain a soils report and even more critical to have an appropriate structur-

al plan. Without those necessities,the structure is very likely to fail somewhere down the line.

We engineers are so keenly aware ofthis need that most of us add notes to our standard details stating that the plan is only applicable in uniform and suitable soil conditions.

◗Seismic events: Fortunately,this is-

n t an issue all ofus must consider,but in areas through most ofCalifornia,for ex- ample,there is a definite concern about the effects of seismic activity — that is, earthquakes — on the structures we de- sign and build.

I won t dig deeply into this topic here. Suffice it to say,ifyou live in a region that contains earthquake faults,you can be certain that,at some point,the structures you build will be subjected to some lev- el of seismic activity. It s not a matter of *if*,but a matter of *when*.

Shell Specific

All of the information I ve offered in this quick overview of engineering is- sues has been directed to defining the role ofengineers and engineering in wa- tershape design and installation — and to demonstrate,I hope,the value of the engineer s role in ensuring the long-term integrity ofa watershape s concrete-and- steel structure.

A lot ofwhat s been covered so far ac- tually applies to all structures set on or in the ground, but there are some issues we ve already covered that are specific to pools and spas and other watershapes — and we ll delve deeply into those specifics in articles to come.

One example ofsuch a watershape-spe- cific issue has to do with the common phenomenon ofcracking at the skimmer. It s not difficult to understand why this happens,because the steel reinforcement

The Expansion Index![](Aspose.Words.98baccbd-2e8c-4654-87e5-a18b13cc0832.009.png)

Expansion Equivalent

When expansive soils get wet, they want to expand.   Index Fluid Pressure

This happens because of the particle size of the soil itself and the way it

changes as water is absorbed.  Clay soils are the most expansive because they

21-30 33

start with the smallest particle size.  Silts have bigger particles and are less ex-

31-40 35

pansive, while sandy soils have even larger particles and are often classified as

41-60 40

non-expansive.  

61-80 43

Soils with smaller particles are more expansive because of capillary action

81-90 45

that draws water between the soil particles and causes the soil to expand like

91-100 50

a dried-out sponge.  A measuring system called the Expansion Index measures

101-110 53

how much a given quantity of soil will expand when it becomes wet.  The

111-120 55

Expansion Index is then converted to an  equivalent fluid pressure  that is used

121-130 58

as the soil pressure force in designing the wall of the watershape.

Each time you see a buckled or uplifted deck, it s more than likely you re look-

around many skimmers is installed in such a way that it creates a weak spot in the bond beam that invites the possibil- ity of cracking. In fact,any watershape subject to differential settlement will like- ly crack first at the skimmer because that is the bond beam s weakest spot.

In future articles, we ll look at this and other watershape-specific issues, pull them apart,look at causes and ex- plore ways of anticipating and pre- venting problems.

By way ofconcluding this first article, let me say that failures such as cracking at the skimmer are often,but not *always*, the result ofsome sort ofcode violation. I know that many contractors do not like building inspectors and resent hav- ing to follow construction codes, but what s forgotten in the midst ofthe an- imosity is that codes are there as much to protect the builder as they are to help homeowners.

To achieve true success with water- shaping and exploit all of their wonder- ful aesthetic possibilities,designers,engi- neers and builders must work together in building concrete and steel structures that take those protections into account and prepare them to stand the test of time — hidden away in perfect obscurity.

IT’S NOT ALWAYSthe case, but very often the kind of cracking that appears around skimmers has as much to do with a failure to observe basic building codes as it does with the hinge effect and differential settlement.  The skimmer is the shell’s weakest point and must be engineered and installed properly.
